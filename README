To avoid running same batch at the same time. 
This is useful for Rails script/runner, for example.

== Usage

BatchLock.run(batch_name, &block)
Lock some batch.

BatchLock.running?(batch_name, &block)
Check some batch running?


== Example

begin
  BatchLock.run(:go_to_park) do
    # All users go to park!
    User.find(all).each(&:go_to_park)
  end
rescue BatchLockException
  logger.error "already running..."
end


If another batch named :go_to_park is running, you can't run batch.
